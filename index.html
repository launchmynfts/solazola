						<p class="about__text text">Hello! 
							We are a team of Solana mints searchers. <br><br>We analyze many projects every day and among them we find only the most profitable and best projects! 
							Recently, we managed to notice about 100 different projects that could make money. 
							We had an idea - to launch a free NFT collection. 
							Very soon we will announce the first batch of NFTs. 
							Having received SolaTaursDAO NFT, you will get access to our Discord, where the whole process of collecting information and evaluating future NFT projects on the Solana blockchain takes place. 
							Also in our discord there will be a drawing of our merch and other various contests! 
							You may ask "Why is minting free?" 
							Our goal is to create an organic DAO community! 
							We don't have a goal to make money on this - we just need new people to evaluate projects, AMA sessions, etc. 
							Of course in future, when we take our place in the NFT market and more people will know about us we will do 2nd gen of our NFT's so that more people could join us.<br><br>Roadmap of our DAO is ready and we will publish it after we will sold out, but little part of roadmap we will tell you now!
							1) 50% of money what we get from our calls, and our 2nd gen mint will go to buy access to alpha groups and other DAO's, to get more private info
							2) 20% will go to community wallets, it will be divided among most active users like a payment for his work
							3) 20% will go to promotions and etc.
							4) 10% will go to devs
							After mint we will distribute roles among holders:
							Searchers- this role owners will help us to research projects and negotiate with projects to receive Whitelist Spots and free NFT's for our DAO. Owners of this role will get access to payments from community wallet
							Chat moderators - this role owners will help us in chat moderation and help newcomers. Owners of this role will get access to payments from community wallet
							And last part of our community will have no roles, they will get calls and they won't have any responsibilities, but big part of benefits of our DAO will be unable to this guys!</p>
